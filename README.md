# Malware Classifier

The project is used to create and test a TensorFlow model trained using the EMBER dataset to classify malware samples.

## Setup

To download the EMBER dataset visit the GitHub page: https://github.com/elastic/ember

Create a virtualised environement using **Python 3.6** and install the requirements file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Using the EMBER  instructions vectorize the dataset


The model can then be trained

```
python training_model.py
```

The model should be saved in a .h5 format, along with the sacler in a .pkl format

## Testing the model

To test the model the EMBER library will need to be imported, this is to access the features.py file used for PE file extraction

The **tester.py** file is currently setup for cloud deployment but can be easily adjusted for CLI use.

```
python tester.py file.exe
```

## Deploy to the Cloud

To test the model in a cloud environment upload all the files supplied here along with the model and scaler into a Google Cloud Run container, ensure the service being used to deploy the container has additonal memory beyond the deafault allocation. Use the Dockerfile to setup to environemtn as needed.
